### *Understanding Communication Protocols in ROS2*

> *ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2) is a powerful and flexible framework for building robot applications. One of its key features is the variety of communication protocols it offers to facilitate interaction between different parts of a robotic system. In this blog, we'll explore three primary communication protocols in ROS2: Topics, Services, and Actions. We'll also provide some ROS CLI commands and examples to help you get started.*

#### [1. Introduction to ROS2 Communication Protocols](intro_to_comm_proto.md)
>    - **Overview and Importance**
>      - Brief introduction to ROS2 communication mechanisms.
>      - Importance of understanding communication protocols in robotics applications.
<!-- 
#### [2. ROS2 Topics](ros2_topics.md)
>    - **Concept and Functionality**
>      - What are ROS2 Topics?
>      - How do they enable communication between nodes?
>    - **Practical Example**
>      - Walkthrough of a simple publisher-subscriber example.
>    - **ROS CLI Commands**
>      - Using `ros2 topic` commands to list, echo, and publish topics. -->
   
#### [3. ROS2 Services](ros2_services.md)
>    - **Concept and Functionality**
>      - What are ROS2 Services?
>      - How do they differ from Topics?
>    - **Practical Example**
>      - Implementing a service server and client.
>    - **ROS CLI Commands**
>      - Using `ros2 service` commands to list, call, and find services.

#### [4. ROS2 Actions](ros2_actions.md)
>    - **Concept and Functionality**
>      - What are ROS2 Actions?
>      - Differences and use cases compared to Topics and Services.
>    - **Practical Example**
>      - Setting up an action server and client.
>    - **ROS CLI Commands**
>      - Using `ros2 action` commands to list, send goals, and get results.

#### [5. Comparing Topics, Services, and Actions](ros2_comm_compare.md)
>    - **Use Case Scenarios**
>      - When to use Topics, Services, or Actions.
>      - Comparative analysis based on latency, reliability, and complexity.

<!-- #### [6. Hands-on Project](ros2_comm_proj.md)
>    - **Integrative Example**
>      - A comprehensive project combining Topics, Services, and Actions.
>      - Real-world application to reinforce learning. -->
