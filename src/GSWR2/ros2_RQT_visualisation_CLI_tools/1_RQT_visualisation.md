# RQT Visualisation

One of the most powerful and versatile tools in ROS is RQT (ROS Qt-based Graphical User Interface Tools).


### What is RQT?

RQT is an integral part of the Robot Operating System (ROS) ecosystem, designed to facilitate the interaction, visualization, and analysis of ROS-based robotics systems. As a collection of graphical user interface (GUI) plugins, RQT leverages the power of the Qt framework, a versatile, cross-platform toolkit for creating complex and robust GUIs.

### Key Features and Capabilities of RQT

- **Visualization**

    - RQT Plot: A plugin for plotting data in real-time, useful for monitoring sensor data, robot states, and other variables.
    - RQT Graph: This visualizes the computational graph of ROS nodes and the communication between them, helping developers understand the flow of data and interactions within the system.
    - RQT Image View: A tool for displaying image data from cameras or other imaging sensors in real-time, which is critical for tasks like computer vision and navigation.

- **Analysis**

    - RQT Console: Provides a logging interface where users can view and filter log messages from different nodes, facilitating debugging and performance monitoring.
    -  RQT Bag: Allows users to play back and analyze data from ROS bag files, which are used to record and store ROS message data for offline analysis and testing.


- **Interaction**


    - RQT Reconfigure: Enables dynamic reconfiguration of parameters in ROS nodes without restarting them, allowing for real-time tuning and adjustments.
    - RQT Service Caller: Provides an interface for calling ROS services, making it easier to interact with service servers directly from a GUI.


### ‚ÄçHow to install rqt plugin
```bash
sudo apt install ros-humble-rqt ros-humble-rqt-common-plugins
```

### Verify Installation:
After installation, you can verify it by running RQT:
```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
rqt
```
This should open the RQT graphical interface. If it opens without errors, the installation was successful.

### useful plugins include:

#### 1. rqt_graph
rqt_graph visualizes the ROS computation graph, showing nodes and the topics they publish and subscribe to.

#### usage

- Launch rqt_graph from the terminal:
```bash
rqt_graph
```

#### Features:

- The graph will display active nodes and their connections. It helps in understanding the communication flow between different parts of your system.
- Dynamic updates as nodes and topics change.
- Filtering options to focus on specific parts of the graph.

### 2. rqt_console
rqt_console provides a graphical view of ROS log messages, allowing you to filter and analyze them more easily than with the standard console output.

#### Usage:

- Launch rqt_console from the terminal:

```bash 
rqt_console
```
#### Features:
- The console displays log messages categorized by severity (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL).
- Filtering based on node, severity, and message content.
- Pause and resume log display.
- Save log messages to a file for later analysis.

### 3. rqt_plot

- rqt_plot plots numeric values from ROS topics in real-time, providing a graphical representation of sensor data, control signals, or other numerical information.

#### Usage:
- Launch rqt_plot from the terminal:

```bash
rqt_plot
```
- Enter the topic names you want to plot.
### add image

#### Features:
- Supports multiple plots and multiple topics per plot.
- Customizable axes and scales.
- Useful for monitoring real-time data trends.

### 4. rqt_image_view
rqt_image_view displays images from ROS topics, useful for monitoring camera feeds or processed images.

#### Usage:
- Launch rqt_image_view from the terminal:

```bash
rqt_image_view
```
- Select the image topic you want to display.
### add image

#### Features:
- Real-time display of image streams.
- Supports different image formats and encoding types.
- Adjustable display settings like zoom and rotation.

### 5. rqt_tf_tree
rqt_tf_tree visualizes the TF (transform) tree, showing the relationship between coordinate frames in ROS.

#### Usage:

- Launch rqt_tf_tree from the terminal: 
```bash
rqt_tf_tree
```
- View the hierarchical relationship between frames.

#### Features:

- Dynamic updates as the TF tree changes.
- Useful for understanding the spatial relationships in robotic systems.

### Conclusion
RQT enhances the ROS experience by bringing the convenience and efficiency of GUIs to the robotics development workflow. By utilizing the Qt framework, RQT offers a powerful and flexible platform for visualization, analysis, and interaction, making it an indispensable tool for developers, researchers, and operators working with ROS-enabled robots and systems. Its ability to simplify complex tasks, provide real-time feedback, and integrate seamlessly with other ROS components underscores its importance in the field of robotics.
