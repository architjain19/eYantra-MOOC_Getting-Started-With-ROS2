### *Understanding Communication Protocols in ROS2*

> *ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2) is a powerful and flexible framework for building robot applications. One of its key features is the variety of communication protocols it offers to facilitate interaction between different parts of a robotic system. In this blog, we'll explore three primary communication protocols in ROS2: Topics, Services, and Actions. We'll also provide some ROS CLI commands and examples to help you get started.*
