> The Robot Operating System (ROS) has been a cornerstone in the field of robotics, offering a flexible framework for writing robot software. As robotics technology has advanced, so too has the need for a more robust, secure, and versatile operating system. This led to the evolution from ROS1 to ROS2. In this blog, we will explore the key differences between ROS1 and ROS2, focusing on architecture, communication, performance and reliability, security, compatibility and portability, and development and deployment.

### 1. Architecture

- **Comparison of the Underlying Architecture**

    > One of the fundamental differences between ROS1 and ROS2 lies in their underlying architecture. ROS1 was built on a custom middleware that, while effective, had limitations in terms of scalability, real-time performance, and flexibility. In contrast, ROS2 was designed to address these limitations by leveraging the Data Distribution Service (DDS) standard.

- **Middleware: ROS1's Custom Middleware vs. ROS2's DDS**

    > ROS1â€™s custom middleware provided the necessary tools and infrastructure for robot software development. However, it struggled with real-time performance and scalability as robotic systems grew in complexity. ROS2, on the other hand, uses DDS, a proven standard in the world of real-time and distributed systems. DDS provides ROS2 with improved scalability, flexibility, and real-time capabilities, making it better suited for the demands of modern robotics.

### 2. Communication

- **Differences in Communication Paradigms**

    > ROS1 and ROS2 differ significantly in their communication paradigms. ROS1 employs a publish-subscribe model that, while effective, can become cumbersome in complex systems due to its reliance on a centralized master node.

- **Improvements in Inter-Process and Inter-Node Communication**

    > ROS2 introduces substantial improvements in communication. By using DDS, ROS2 supports direct communication between nodes without the need for a master node. This decentralized approach enhances both inter-process and inter-node communication, reducing latency and improving reliability. Additionally, ROS2 supports various Quality of Service (QoS) policies, allowing developers to fine-tune communication based on the needs of their applications.

### 3. Performance and Reliability

- **Enhanced Real-Time Capabilities**

    > Real-time performance was a notable limitation of ROS1, making it less suitable for applications requiring stringent timing constraints. ROS2 addresses this by incorporating features that support real-time operations. The use of DDS allows ROS2 to provide deterministic communication and execution, essential for real-time robotics applications.

- **Quality of Service (QoS) Policies in ROS2**

    > Another key enhancement in ROS2 is the introduction of QoS policies. These policies enable developers to specify the reliability, durability, and latency requirements for communication. This flexibility ensures that ROS2 can meet the diverse needs of different robotic applications, from low-latency control systems to high-reliability data streams.

### 4. Security

- **Security Enhancements in ROS2**

    > Security was not a primary focus during the development of ROS1, leading to potential vulnerabilities in robotic applications. ROS2, however, places a strong emphasis on security, incorporating several enhancements to protect against threats.

- **Secure Communication Features**

    > ROS2 leverages DDS security standards to provide secure communication channels. Features such as authentication, encryption, and access control are built into the core of ROS2, ensuring that data transmitted between nodes is protected from unauthorized access and tampering.

### 5. Compatibility and Portability

- **Cross-Platform Support (Windows, Linux, macOS)**

    > One of the significant advancements in ROS2 is its cross-platform support. While ROS1 was primarily designed for Unix-based systems, ROS2 extends support to Windows, Linux, and macOS. This cross-platform compatibility broadens the scope of applications that can leverage ROS2, making it accessible to a wider range of developers and industries.

- **Mobile and Embedded System Compatibility**

    > ROS2 also addresses the growing need for mobile and embedded system compatibility. Its lightweight and flexible architecture make it suitable for deployment on resource-constrained devices, enabling the development of sophisticated robotic applications on mobile and embedded platforms.

### 6. Development and Deployment

- **Differences in Development Tools and Processes**

    > ROS2 introduces several improvements in development tools and processes. The build system in ROS2, based on CMake and colcon, offers better dependency management and build performance compared to ROS1's catkin. Additionally, ROS2 provides more robust debugging and logging tools, enhancing the development experience.

- **Improvements in Deployment and Lifecycle Management**

    > Deployment and lifecycle management have also seen significant enhancements in ROS2. The introduction of managed nodes and lifecycle states allows for more controlled startup, shutdown, and runtime management of nodes. This feature is particularly beneficial for complex robotic systems that require precise control over their components.

### Conclusion

> The evolution from ROS1 to ROS2 marks a significant leap forward in the capabilities and versatility of the Robot Operating System. By addressing the limitations of ROS1 and incorporating modern standards and features, ROS2 provides a robust, secure, and scalable platform for the future of robotics. Whether you are developing real-time applications, deploying on mobile and embedded systems, or requiring enhanced security, ROS2 offers the tools and infrastructure to meet the demands of modern robotics.
