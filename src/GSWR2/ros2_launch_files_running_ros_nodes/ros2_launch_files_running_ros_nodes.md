# Launch files and running ROS nodes


> **1. ROS Nodes**
Nodes are the fundamental building blocks of a ROS-based system. Each node is a single-purpose executable that performs computation. ROS nodes can communicate with each other using topics, services, and actions.

> **2. Launch files**
Launch files are XML files that facilitate the launching of multiple nodes and setting parameters. They provide a convenient way to start a group of nodes and configure them with the required parameters and remappings.
